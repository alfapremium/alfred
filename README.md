# Alfred

Alfred is a terminal-first AI coding agent CLI that unifies cloud and local model providers. It provides a single developer workflow for prompts, tools, agents, tasks, streaming output, and model-specific onboarding.

## What This Project Is

This repository contains the Alfred CLI implementation, including:

- a cross-provider command-line runtime
- provider onboarding and profile management
- tool calling for shell, file operations, search, and more
- optional VS Code extension support
- headless gRPC server support for automation and integration

The repo is not currently published as an Alfred npm package, so install locally from this repository instead of using `npm install -g alfred-openclaude`.

## Features

- Unified CLI for cloud and local model backends
- Support for OpenAI-compatible APIs, Gemini, GitHub Models, Codex OAuth, Codex, Ollama, Atomic Chat, and more
- Guided provider onboarding and saved provider profiles
- Rich tool-driven workflows: bash, file editing, grep, glob, agents, tasks, and slash commands
- Streaming tokens and live tool progress
- Optional memory companion and agent routing
- Headless gRPC server for external integration
- VS Code extension support in `vscode-extension/openclaude-vscode`

## Recommended Local Setup

From the repository root:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\alfred2\openclaude\alfred
bun install
bun run build
```

Then install locally for global CLI use:

```powershell
npm install -g .
```

If you prefer to run directly without a global install:

```powershell
bun run dev
```

## Running the CLI

Launch the tool:

```powershell
alfred
```

Compatibility aliases also work:

```powershell
openclaude
openclaw
```

## Provider Setup

Start provider onboarding from within the CLI:

```powershell
alfred onboard
```

For GitHub Models onboarding:

```powershell
alfred onboard-github
```

You can also run provider setup directly:

```powershell
/provider
```

### Fastest OpenAI Setup

```powershell
$env:CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI = "1"
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-key-here"
$env:OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o"
alfred
```

### Fastest Local Ollama Setup

```powershell
$env:CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI = "1"
$env:OPENAI_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
$env:OPENAI_MODEL = "qwen2.5-coder:7b"
alfred
```
